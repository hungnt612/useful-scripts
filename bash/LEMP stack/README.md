This script will install Nginx, MySQL, and PHP, and configure them for use as a LEMP stack. It will also set up the necessary firewall rules and enable the services to start on boot.

Note that this script assumes that you are using PHP version 7.4, which is the current version at the time of writing. If you are using a different version of PHP, you will need to modify the script accordingly. Also, this script assumes that you are using a Ubuntu/Debian based system. If you are using a different distribution, you may need to modify the package installation commands to match your system's package manager.
